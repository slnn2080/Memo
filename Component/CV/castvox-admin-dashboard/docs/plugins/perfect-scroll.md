# Perfect scrollbar

“Minimalistic but perfect custom scrollbar plugin.”


!IMPORTANT Perfect Scrollbar is applied on the `Sidebar` component so we will have a nice scrollbar
that is visible only when you actually scroll.

Since it is changing the overflows of the CSS it is also affecting 
the child elements which have a scroll so please make sure that you add the  
class `.ps-child` to any element that should have scroll.

For more information please check [Full Github Documentation](https://github.com/utatti/perfect-scrollbar)

```js
import PerfectScrollbar from 'perfect-scrollbar';
import 'perfect-scrollbar/css/perfect-scrollbar.css';


new PerfectScrollbar('.sidebar');
```
